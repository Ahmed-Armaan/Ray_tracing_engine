# A small implementation of ray tracing algo I did for the college project

Ray tracing is a powerful rendering technique used in computer graphics to generate realistic 3-dimentional images by simulating the behavior of light rays in a scene. It has applications in various fields such as animation, visualization, and virtual reality. However, implementing a ray tracing algorithm involves complex computations and optimization challenges.
